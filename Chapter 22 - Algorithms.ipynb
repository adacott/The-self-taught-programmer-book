    "\n",
    "Recursion is a method of solving problems by breaking the problem up into smaller and smaller pieces until it can be easily solved. So far, you've solved problems using iterative algorithms. Iterative algorithms solve problems by repeating steps over and over, typically using a loop. Recursive algorithms rely on functions that call themselves. Any problem you can solve iteratively can be solved recursively; however, sometimes a recursive algorithm is a more elegant solution. You write a recursive algorithm inside of a function. The function must have a base case: a condition that ends a recursive algorithm to stop it from continuing forever. Inside the function, the function calls itself. Each time the function calls itself, it moves closer to the base case. Eventually, the base case condition is satisfied, the problem is solved, and the function stops calling itself. An algorithm that follows these rules satisfies the three laws of recursion: \n",
    "1. A recursive algorithm must have a base case. \n",
    "2. A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case. \n",
