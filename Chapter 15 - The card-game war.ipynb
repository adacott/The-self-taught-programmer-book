    "The Card class has two class variables, suits and values. suits is a list of strings representing all the suits a card could be: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. values is a list of strings representing the different numeric values a card could be: 2–10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. The items at the first two indexes of the values list are None, so that the strings in the list match up with the index they represent—so the string \"2\" in the values list is at index 2. Card objects have two instance variables: suit and value—each represented by an integer. Together, the instance variables represent what kind of card the Card object is. For example, you create a 2 of hearts by creating a Card object and passing it the parameters 2 (for the suit) and 1 (for the value—1 because hearts is at index 1 in the suits list). The definitions in the magic methods __lt__ and __gt__ allow you to compare two Card objects in an expression using the greater than and less than operators. The code in these methods determines if the card is greater than or less than the other card passed in as a parameter. The code in these magic methods can also handle if the cards have the same value—for example if both cards are 10s. If this occurs, the methods use the value of the suits to break the tie. The suits are arranged in order of strength in the suits list—with the strongest suit last, and thus assigned the highest index, and the least powerful suit assigned the lowest index."

    "When you initialize the Deck object, the two for-loops in __init__ create Card objects representing all the cards in a 52-card deck and appends them to the cards list. The first loop is from 2 to 15 because the first value for a card is 2, and the last value for a card is 14 (the ace). Each time around the inner loop, a new card is created using the integer from the outer loop as the value (i.e., 14 for an ace) and the integer from the inner loop as the suit (i.e. a 2 for hearts). This process creates 52 cards—one card for every suit and value combination. After the method creates the cards, the shuffle method from the random module randomly rearranges the items in the cards list; mimicking the shuffling of a deck of cards. Our deck has one other method called rm_card that removes and returns a card from the cards list, or returns None if it is empty. You can use the Deck class to create a new deck of cards and print each card in it:\n"
