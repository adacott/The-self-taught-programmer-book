    Your web browser uses the different HTML tags in your HTML file to display this website. 
    An HTML tag (tag for short) is like a programming keyword—it tells your browser to do something. 
    Most tags have a beginning tag and closing tag, often with text in between. For example, your browser 
    displays the text in between the <title> </title> tags in the tab of your browser. You can have tags within tags; 
    everything in between <head></head> is metadata about the web page, whereas everything in between <body></body> 
    makes up the actual site. Together, the <a></a> tags create a link. Tags can hold data. For example, href="https://www.google.com" 
    inside of the <a> tag lets the browser know what website to link to. There is a lot more to HTML, but with this knowledge 
        you are ready to build your first web scraper.
